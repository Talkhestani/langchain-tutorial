Avicenna, also known as Ibn Sina, was one of the greatest Persian scientists and philosophers of the medieval period. He was born in 980 AD in Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan) and died in 1037 AD in Hamadan.

He specialized in medicine, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. His most famous work, *The Canon of Medicine*, was taught in European universities for several centuries.

Avicenna wrote more than 450 books and treatises, of which around 240 have survived. Along with Rhazes, he is considered one of the founders of modern medicine.
